Hi! Our names are Julianna White and Kevin Deguzman, and we're the founders of MentalMatch. As juniors at UC Berkeley, we are often under a lot of stress to do well in classes, be involved in a variety of extracurricular activities, have a good social life, get enough sleep, and so much more. With all this pressure, it is no surprise that UC Berkeley students suffer from a variety of mental health conditions- just like college students and everyone else all over the world. 
    <br>
    <br>
    While we've found that Berkeley does have a lot of resources available to students, it does not have enough to help everyone. Additionally, the resources frequently cost money that hard-working college students do not have. In order to help solve this, we created MentalMatch, a web-app that allows people who are having mental health problems to get connected with people who can help them. We hope you find our website useful! Please don't hesitate to reach out. :)
