Around the world, one in every four people are affected by mental health problems.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class = "blurb"> Despite this alarming statistic, many of these people do not receive the proper care they need due to a lack of nearby professionals, bad healthcare plans, large expenses, and more. Not dealing with mental illnesses is serious. It not only affects the individual, but the people around them as well. It is something that needs to be addressed as soon as possible in order to find an effective and efficient solution. This is difficult when you don't have the necessary recources to actually do this though. </p>
<br>
<p class = "blurb"> Through MentalMatch, we are hoping to solve the problem of people with mental health problems not being able to get the care they need. Rather than not knowing what to do, they can make an account on MentalMatch. There, they can choose from a variety of professionals who all specialize in the user's specific problem. If the professional selects them too, then there is a match! The pair is able to chat online about the problems and potential solutions, discuss what's working and not working, or they could even meet in person if both people feel comfortable.  </p>
